# IBM-Data-Science-Course-9-Final-Project

This is the final project in course 9 of the IBM Data Science Course on Coursera. In this project, the primary task is to build a rainfall prediction classifier using machine learning techniques (i.e., train/test split, cross-validation, logistic regression, confusion matrices, etc.)

The following skills and objectives are covered in this project:
- Using a real-world data set in order to explore/work with feature engineering
- Using grid search cross validation to optimize a classifier pipeline
- Model evaluation by analyzing performance metrics and visualizations
- Implementing a different classifier by updating pipeline
- Using appropriate set of parameters for each case
